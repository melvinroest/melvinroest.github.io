					<h2>Extra Documentation - master theses</h2>
					<p>
						Over the years, students have ported or extended XIMPEL. Regarding the JavaScript version of XIMPEL that is documented on this website two people wrote their thesis about it. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Stefan Bruins wrote his thesis in 2016. His task was to port XIMPEL from its ActionScript roots to JavaScript. Some finer implementation details regarding the framework is in there in much more detail than the documentation. <a href="theses/master_thesis_stefan_bruins.pdf">You can downoad his thesis here</a>.
					</p>
						In 2018, Melvin Roest wrote his thesis. This thesis has much more of an exploratory focus. In it you will find: implementation details regarding extensions of XIMPEL. The implementation of a port for XIMPEL to ReactJS is shown. The implementation of a logging framework is presented. And the history leading up to XIMPEL, possible ideas for XIMPEL applications and light philosophical and design questions are presented in there as well. <a href="theses/master_thesis_melvin_roest.pdf">You can download his thesis here</a>.
